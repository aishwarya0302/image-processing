exp-1 Image Resizing Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
exp-1a Image Rotation Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
exp-1b Image Translation Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
